* Express.js: a web application framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
* TypeScript: a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, classes, and interfaces to the language.
* Jest: a testing framework for Node.js that provides a simple and easy-to-use way to write unit tests for your code.
